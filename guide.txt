Step-by-Step Guide to Plot Spin-Texture Using QE Data
1. Parse bands data (.dat) will be written in the format of kx ky kz nbnd_1 nbnd_2 ……[
in the nbnd column there will be energy].
band_data_parser.ipynb
2. Parse spin data(.dat.1,.dat.2,.dat.3) will be written in the format of kx ky kz nbnd_1
nbnd_2 ……[ in the nbnd column there will be expectation value of spin operator].

3. To plot the individual band's spin texture make an Excel file of kx, ky,sx,sy and sz for
a particular band from the previously generated .csv file.
4. To plot the spin texture of individual bands with sz as background and sx,sy as vector
arrow in the kx-ky plane.
background_sz_arrow_sx_sy.ipynb
5. To plot the spin texture of individual bands with sz as the colour of the (sx,sy) vector
arrow in the kx-ky plane.

6. To make the bands parse data [ E-Ef]

7. To make the bands parse data [ E-Ef] and up to three-digit precision

8. To find the considerable bands that are cutting an iso-energy surface with the whole
kx,ky range and plot them.

9. To find the considerable bands which are cutting an iso-energy surface with varying
kx,ky range.

crssing_band_filtered.ipynb
11. To get the kx, ky value where particular bands are crossing the iso-energy surface and
with a data file [ kx_nbnd_ ky_nbnd_ nbnd_energy]

12. Extract the sx,sy and sz values of a particular band three .csv file for three spin
projection.

13. Find the sx,sy,sz value of the particular band at those kx,ky point where bands are
crossing the isosurface.

14. Make an excel with the kx,ky,s file from the previous .csv data file
15. To plot them separately

16. To plot the spin-texture combined
